### Limit Break is your friend!
{{% notice tip %}}
You can find the action **Limit Break** in your "Actions & Traits" window, under "General". 
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice info %}}
Generally speaking, Limit Break is saved for the last boss for the DPS to use when the boss hits 10% health. This changes as you get further into trials / dungeons / etc. There are unique trials that require the use of LB3 by specific roles in certain circumstances.

If you die in battle...

1. ...and are **raised/revived/etc** during combat: **DO NOT: CAST, PERFORM AN ACTION, PERFORM A WEAPONSKILL**. You have a few seconds of invulnerability. Give the healer a chance to heal you back up.
1. ...you will get a **weakness** debuff. This means your main stat (STR, DEX, INT, MIND) is reduced by 25%.
1. **If you die again while under the weakness effect**, you get the **Brink of Death** debuff which reduces those stats down by 50%. 

### Know your interrupts!

{{% notice warning %}}
You have to test to find out which stuns / interrupts work. General rule of thumb, is the left castbar can be stunned or interrupted, and the right may be stunable.
