The fastest way to obtain Protean crystals is farming fates.
you will recieve Anemos crystals, which you can grind down to Protean crystal.
this is done by talking to Gerolt, using the "exchange Anemos crystals" funktion

Once again, the fastest way to farm Crystals is by doing fates. light will be collected by doing fates, killing mobs grps (must be on par or higher with your current level) and killing the void Dragons in the area

We are almost done there, this is the victory lab, this time there is no special requirement / item to complete the relic!
so the fate grind continues and the goal to kill Providence Water, the map boss of Hydaots

| Item | Required Amount | Item 2 | Required Amount | Which step? |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: | -- |

| Hydatos Crystals | 100 ||| +2
| Hydatos Crystals | 100 | Crystalline Scales | 5 | Hydatos Base relic Complete |

## Base Relic complete?
Eureka Hydatos has one final encounter, which is optional and doesnt change the weapon effect. But it gives you a neat damage boost!
This final encounter is called "Baldesion Arsenal" which is a 56 man dungeon. If you decide to complete the relic fully, you will need.
****100 Eurekan Fragments****

### how do i get into the Baldesion Arsenal?
Since it is quite a massive dungeon, it needs some organistaion. Luckly, there are great people that host runs from time to time!
