The SpicyChicken Quest website is build on the foundation of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). For those techie, you read about it through the link before.

For everyone else, you do not need to know how it works, why it works, or what it does. The only thing you need to know is that it must be on your system in order for you to contribute to the website.

## Why did I choose Hugo?
I knew I wanted as many people as possible to be able to contribute, but I wanted to do it in a way that expanded knowledge and opened up the world of programming / contributing / etc to others. The fact that people can just make pages and design them with [Markdown](/git-involved/markdown) seriously appealed. Add in that it's a static site and it makes my inner Darth Securitas feel much better. 

Add in the fact that it is very easy to do localisation and it means that people can translate as well! Gotta love that!

## How to Hugo?
As stated above, you need to have Hugo on your system in order for you to easily check changes as you contribute. This guide is intended (for the moment) for those on Windows and who have zero knowledge on how to do this crazy thing called Hugo. 

### Step 1: Get the Hugo version that best fits you!
1. Head over to [Hugo's Releases on Github](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases).
1. Scroll down till you see the list of **Assets** and find the one for your version of Windows!
1. Download the zip file.
1. Extract the contents to a location of your choosing. It will have a readme, License and hugo.exe (the real powerhouse of what we do).
### Step 2: Tell Windows where to find Hugo
1. Go to the Windows Start button and do a search for "Edit the System Enviornment Settings". We need to tell Windows how to find hugo.exe! 
1. In the System Properties window, select Enviornment Variables (bottom right of Advanced tab)
1. Select the user variable "Path" and click "Edit..."
1. Click "Browse..." and navigate to the folder you put hugo.exe in.
1. Click "Okay"
1. Then you can click Ok to get out of all the variables and settings for your system. 
### Step 3: Oh yeeah!
1. Celebrate!
