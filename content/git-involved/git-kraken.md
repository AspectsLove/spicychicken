**[QuickLink to Tirzah's Referral Link for GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/rELPRTpS)**

## Why do I recommend using GitKraken?
The answer to this is multifold: 

1. It's a very easy tool to start learning git and versioning. 
2. It's easy to teach someone how to pull, push, branch, fork, merge, do pull requests, etc. 
3. It's **exceptional** for those new to the world of git allowing anyone to git involved in a project!
1. It has a very beautiful interface.
1. It's got the most magnificent mascot in the form of Keif! The team even made a version of Keif as Ada Lovelace for her. *swoon*
1. Tirzah is a damn proud Ambassador of GitKraken.
