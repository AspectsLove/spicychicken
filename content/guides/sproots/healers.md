### Your job is more than healing
{{% notice warning %}}
**Be sure you DPS**! For all encounters the developers include healer DPS for mechanics, enrages, etc. Get used to it now.
{{% /notice %}}

### You do not have to keep people at 100% health
{{% notice note %}}
As long as they enough health to survive the tankbuster or raidwide, they are fine! There is passive healing in combat and massive passive healing out of combat!
{{% /notice %}}

### Plan for your group run
{{% notice tip %}}
**Check your party's gear**, you'll want to know if they are undergeared for the level dungeon/trial/raid you are doing.
{{% /notice %}}

### Know what and when to Esuna
{{% notice info %}}
You can tell something is removable by Esuna by the debuff icon. Small blue line over the debuff means you can cleanse it. 
{{% /notice %}}

| Removable by Esuna | Not Removable by Esuna |
| --- | --- |
| ![removable](/images/removable.jpg) | ![not-removable](/images/not-removable.jpg) |

{{% notice tip %}}
It's not always worth it to **Esuna** a debuff. You can lose valuable DPS time as **Esuna** is a cast, not instant, and sometimes the damage done by the debuff is trivial.

### Know who and when to bring someone back to life
{{% notice warning %}}
Following mechanics is more important than picking someone up who died!
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice info %}}
You can bring someone back in the middle of combat. 
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice  tip %}}
Using a **Swiftcast** Raise, Resurrection, Ascend can bring someone back while you're on the move!
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice note %}}
If the person you pick up starts to do anything and ignores [this tip](http://spicychicken.quest/guides/sproots/everyone/#death-happens), there is a good chance they will die without you healing them up for a raidwide. Don't feel bad.

### You too can use use Limit Break!
{{% notice tip %}}
Limit Break 3 brings everyone in your party back to life, with no debuff, and resets cooldowns! **This has saved more trials, extremes, raids, etc than the writer of this guide can count!**
{{% /notice %}}

### Managing your MP 
{{% notice tip %}}
Use **Lucid Dreaming** when your MP gets to about 70% and then keep **Lucid Dreaming** on cooldown!
{{% /notice %}}

### Rescue is both a blessing and a curse
{{% notice warning %}}
Well intentioned healers try to move people or save them using **Rescue**, however some players get really upset if you use it on them.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
**Rescue** only moves the target to be right in front of you, so make sure that space is outside of a mechanic if you're trying to save someone.
{{% /notice %}}

### Surecast will save your life
{{% notice note %}}
You should have **Surecast** on your toolbar. There are a lot of [mechanics](https://spicychicken.quest/guides/group/mechanics/) that move you around the arena that can be completely ignored, or mitigated, by using it!
{{% /notice %}} 

### You have a stun!
{{% notice info %}}
Your **Repose** is actually a [stun](http://spicychicken.quest/guides/sproots/everyone/#know-your-interrupts)!
