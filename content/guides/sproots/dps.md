### DPS
#### Don't stand in front of the boss
It's a good way to get cleaved or tankbusted and die. Dead DPS do no dps.

#### If you're ranged, stay near healer
Healers have heals that are mostly centered around themselves (there are exceptions), but this helps them to be able to do top ups quickly from raidwides.

If you decide to stay as far from everyone as possible, do not be surprised if a healer lets you die*
