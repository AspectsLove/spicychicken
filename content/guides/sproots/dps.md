### If you're ranged, stay near healer
{{% notice tip %}}
Healers have heals that are mostly centered around themselves (there are exceptions), but this helps them to be able to do top ups quickly from raidwides.

{{% notice warning %}}
If you decide to stay as far from everyone as possible, do not be surprised if a healer lets you die. Dead DPS do not DPS.

### Surecast and Arm's Length are your friend!
{{% notice tip%}}
**Surecast** (Casters) and **Arm's Length** (Physical DPS) can be used during some [mechanics](https://spicychicken.quest/guides/group/mechanics/) to allow you to stay in place and finish a cast, or combo!
