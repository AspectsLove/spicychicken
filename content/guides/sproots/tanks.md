### Just because the boss is not physically looking at you does NOT mean you have lost threat
{{% notice tip %}}
There are actions that a boss, or mob will perform that have them physicall turn away from you. This does not mean you have lost threat so you do not need use **Provoke (see next statement)**. Instead, look at the two locations listed below to verify if you still have threat or not.

| The boss is focused on Tirzah to start, the Maiq took over as her threat and the target of target changed | **Red** means you are top of threat; **Orange** means you're near the top of the threat list; **Yellow** means you halfway up the threat list; **Green** means you are very low on the threat list | 

{{% notice warning %}}
As a tank, you want those boxes to be red! Red is your favourite color in the enemy list.

### Provoke is not used on cooldown
{{% notice warning %}}
All provoke does is set your emnity to be equal to the highest level eminity currently on **that** target and then gives you a tiny bit extra emnity on top. Even if you are the one on top! **Save it for an emergancy**.
