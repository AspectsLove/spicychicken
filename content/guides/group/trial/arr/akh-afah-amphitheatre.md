**Hail Storm**: When she changes into Staff, spread out for hall storm. AoE around targets. Set up groups of 2 so you can spread out to 1 of the 4 safe spots while everyone has hail storm circles and the arena spawns circles.

## Phase Three: The Ice Arena
#### Bow Form Added to her Aresenal
{{% notice note %}}
You should avoid the edge to prevent being turned into a popsicle that must be freed by people.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice warning %}}
**Glass Dance**: **Everyone** stands behind her to avoid the damage. It's a 270 degree cone, so hug her bum.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
**Avalanche**: Random person gets marker on head. The knockback can be mitigated with a big shield, **Surecast**, or **Arm's Length**. However, it is worth having the marked person step out of the group to avoid knocking everyone back with them. If you choose to get knocked back, make sure you have plenty of room to be knocked back.
