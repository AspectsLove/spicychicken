 Why GitHub? It&amp;rsquo;s easy for people to contribute, has versioning, and is generally just great. Yes, some people do not like that it&amp;rsquo;s part of the Microsoft family, but honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s perfectly fine for a project like this.</description>

 QuickLink to Tirzah&amp;rsquo;s Referral Link for GitKraken
Why do I recommend using GitKraken? The answer to this is multifold:
 It&amp;rsquo;s a very easy tool to start learning git and versioning. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to teach someone how to pull, push, branch, fork, merge, do pull requests, etc. It&amp;rsquo;s exceptional for those new to the world of git allowing anyone to git involved in a project!</description>

 What is Markdown? It&amp;rsquo;s a very quick way to add visual structure to lines of text!
You do not need to know how to code to use Markdown! You just need to know how to write words!
