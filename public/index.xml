      <description>Limit Break is your friend! You can find the action Limit Break in your &amp;ldquo;Actions &amp;amp; Traits&amp;rdquo; window, under &amp;ldquo;General&amp;rdquo;.
 Generally speaking, Limit Break is saved for the last boss for the DPS to use when the boss hits 10% health. This changes as you get further into trials / dungeons / etc. There are unique trials that require the use of LB3 by specific roles in certain circumstances.</description>

  Map of Dungeon     Special Loot Nothing fancy.
 Trash x 3 The are ranged casters in this dungeon, so group up the mobs near the ranged to ensure AoE emnity is maintained!
 Group up mobs together to allow the very few jobs that have AoE at this level can do so.
 Void Soulcounter x 3  When a Void Soulcounter shows up, it will cast Enthunder which can be interupted quickly in order to prevent it getting an attack speed buff.</description>

      <description>Mechanics are more important than your DPS If you choose to ignore a mechanic, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you will die. Dead DPS do no DPS.
 Don&amp;rsquo;t stand in front of the boss It&amp;rsquo;s a good way to get cleaved or tankbustered and die. Dead DPS do no DPS.
 If you&amp;rsquo;re ranged, stay near healer  Healers have heals that are mostly centered around themselves (there are exceptions), but this helps them to be able to do top ups quickly from raidwides.</description>

  Special Loot Nothing of note
 Trash part 1 Make sure you pick up the tiny key dropped by mobs!
 The first 2 spriggans in the dungeon leash back to the beginning if you do not kill them fast and move too far ahead.
 Kottos Kill adds. Kill adds. Kill adds&amp;hellip; yawn&amp;hellip; kill adds&amp;hellip; Oo boss!</description>

      <guid>https://www.spicychicken.quest/sproots/healers/</guid>
      <description>Your job is more than healing Be sure you DPS! For all encounters the developers include healer DPS for mechanics, enrages, etc. Get used to it now.
 You do not have to keep people at 100% health As long as they enough health to survive the tankbuster or raidwide, they are fine! There is passive healing in combat and massive passive healing out of combat!
 Plan for your group run Check your party&amp;rsquo;s gear, you&amp;rsquo;ll want to know if they are undergeared for the level dungeon/trial/raid you are doing.</description>

      <description>Put on Emnity (threat) Stance Simply having this turned on, you hold threat as long as you hit the targets!
    DRK: Grit WAR: Defiance GNB: Royal Guard PLD: Iron Will            Just because the boss is not physically looking at you does NOT mean you have lost threat There are actions that a boss, or mob will perform that have them physicall turn away from you.</description>

      <description>Throughout your gameplay, you will run across various mechanics that repeat in dungeons, trials, and raids. This is an attempt to help you understand what to do if you see them
 A lot of these mechanics repeat in dungeons, trials, and raids, are are named after some of the first times they show up. Example, Exo Flares was first shown in a fight and was called Exo Flare. So even if a boss uses a different name, the community just recognizes the attack does the exact same thing and will call it that!</description>
