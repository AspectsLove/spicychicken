	"content": " Throughout your gameplay, you will run across various mechanics that repeat in dungeons, trials, and raids. This is an attempt to help you understand what to do if you see them\n A lot of these mechanics repeat in dungeons, trials, and raids, are are named after some of the first times they show up. Example, Exo Flares was first shown in a fight and was called Exo Flare. So even if a boss uses a different name, the community just recognizes the attack does the exact same thing and will call it that!\n    Picture of Mechanic Mechanic Name What does it mean?      Stack Marker This is a huge damage attack that needs to be shared among as many people as possible. Thus\u0026hellip; stack on whoever has the marker    Line Stack Marker This preceeds a line attack from boss through to end of arena. Stand in the line to spread the damage amongst the group!    Action Time Maneuver When you see this show up, prepare to spam your buttons (keyboard / mouse / joystick)    Action Time Maneuver Player Action Spam your buttons (keyboard / mouse / joystick)! We\u0026rsquo;ve all been there! Make sure you do not end up typing into chat when doing this action time event. It will kill you in many cases if you do!    Proximity Marker The closer you are to the marker, the more damage you take. Do not understimate the damage being a medium distance away!    Flare This is a combination of a single target and proximity damage attack. If you have this marker on your heard get away from the group. If you see this marker on someone get as far away from them as possible    Floor Patterns When you see floor markers going in one direction, it means your character will be flung in that direction against your will (Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length or Surecast may help, but it is not always garunteed!)    Gaze No matter the boss, pillar, or mob, if you see a big red eyeball on it, TURN AROUND and put your character\u0026rsquo;s back to the eye. You will end up either confused running around hitting people, get a debuff that will kill you, or other horrible things.    Tower Markers Tower markers need a person to stand in it in order to prevent massive party or raid wide damage.    Exo Flares Circles with arrows point in the direction that it will go. These usually continue in a line and do a heavy damage attack if you\u0026rsquo;re caught by them.    Polarity Same polarity repels targets away from each other. Opposite pulls them in towards each other. More damage the closer you are to start    TETHERS are a mechanic that will be targeted on you, but what that mechanic is tends to be fight specific.\n    Examples of Tethers       Proximity Tether: Move away till the tether becomes purple. If it remains red with arrows, you will take a massive spike of damage and possibly die. Prey Tether: This usually is a tether that can be passed on to someone else. Depending on the fight you may need to pass to a DPS, or a Tank. You call it\u0026rsquo;s a prey tether as you will see the debuff for prey on you. Dragable Tether: This tethers something to you. What you do depends on the boss. Some Examples: You may need to drag what is attached to you through the boss or you may need to run into the orb attached to someone else\u0026rsquo;s tether to prevent them from taking big damage.         It is worth noting, that there are very specific fights where the goal of chains is to hug your partner. Those exceptions are handled in the guide unique to that dungeon, trial, or raid.\n    Chains      If you find yourself chained to someone, move away from them as you will both take continuous damage until that chain breaks. If you start FAR away from the person you become chained to, you have to move EVEN further away from that person to break it.       In the above, we\u0026rsquo;re close taking damage In the above, we\u0026rsquo;re moving away from each other to break the chains    "

	"content": " Fabulous Website: https://ffxiv-eureka.com/\n Weapon Specific Relic Every Instance of Eureka has it\u0026rsquo;s own relic step. In each Individual Instance, there will be a map boss which drops the needed item for the relic.\n You don\u0026rsquo;t have to farm the map boss for their item! The item from Aenmos, Pagos and Pyros can be bought at The Expedition Birdwatcher found in each zone.\n Eureka Anemos    Item Required Amount Which step? Note     Protean Crystal 100 Base    Protean Crystal 400 +1    Protean Crystal 800 +2    Pazuzu feathers 3 Anemos Complete The feathers cost 300 Protean Crystals each if you choose to purchase them    The fastest way to obtain Protean crystals is farming fates. You will recieve Anemos Crystals, which you can grind down to Protean Crystal. This is done by talking to Gerolt and selecting \u0026ldquo;Exchange Anemos Crystals\u0026rdquo;. You will get 2-5 Protean Crystals per Anemos Crystal.\n Eureka Pagos In Eureka Pagos, you will collect \u0026ldquo;light\u0026rdquo; aka Frosted Protean Crystals in your kettle. This kettle can hold up to 9 light. Make sure you complete the lvl 25 quest, which will allow you to empty it at the crystal forge. Location of the Crystal forge: X:6.0 Y:21.5\n    Items needed Which step? Note     Frosted Protean Crystals x 5 +1    Frosted Protean Crystals x 10 and 500 x Pagos Crystals +2    Frosted Protean Crystals x 16 and 5 x Louhi Ice Pagos Complete The Louhi Ice is 50 Pagos Crystals each from the vendor    Once again, the fastest way to farm Crystals is by doing fates. Light will also be collected by doing fates, as well as killing mobs groups (must be on par or higher with your current level) and killing the void Dragons in the area.\n Eureka Pyros Yet again, you will have the kettle to collect light, but this time it is not needed to complete the relic! It is used to reroll the stats on your relic weapon.\n In Eureka Pagos, you need to craft 20 different logograms.\n What are logograms? Logograms are duty actions, which range from buffing yourself, the party or even attack abilities. These can be crafted at the Logogram manipulator.\n    Item Required Amount Item 2 Required Amount Which step?     Pyros crystals 100 Logograms 10 +1   Pyros crystals 200 Logograms 20 +2   Pyros crystals 300 Penthesile\u0026rsquo;s Flame (50 Pyros Crystals each at vendor) 5 Pagos Complete    Eureka Hydatos We are almost done! This is the victory lab! This time there is no special requirement / item to complete the relic! So the fate grind continues and now we add the goal to kill Providence Watcher, the map boss of Hydatos.\n    Item Required Amount Item 2 Required Amount Which step?     Hydatos Crystals 50   Hydatos   Hydatos Crystals 100   +1   Hydatos Crystals 100   +2   Hydatos Crystals 100 Crystalline Scales (these cannot be bought) 5 Hydatos Base relic Complete    Base Relic complete? Eureka Hydatos has one final encounter, which is optional and doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the weapon effect. But it gives you a neat damage boost and a wicked mount! This final encounter is called \u0026ldquo;Baldesion Arsenal\u0026rdquo; which is a 56 man dungeon. If you decide to complete the relic fully, you will need 100 Eurekan Fragments.\n How do I get into the Baldesion Arsenal? Since it is quite a massive dungeon, it needs some organistaion. Luckly, there are great people that host runs from time to time! The Late Night Discord organizes runs. They have all kinds of help to get you started!\n "
