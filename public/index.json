You can find the action Limit Break in your \u0026ldquo;Actions \u0026amp; Traits\u0026rdquo; window, under \u0026ldquo;General\u0026rdquo;.\n Generally speaking, Limit Break is saved for the last boss for the DPS to use when the boss hits 10% health. This changes as you get further into trials / dungeons / etc. There are unique trials that require the use of LB3 by specific roles in certain circumstances.\n Death Happens If you die in battle\u0026hellip;\n  \u0026hellip;and are raised/revived/etc during combat: DO NOT: CAST, PERFORM AN ACTION, PERFORM A WEAPONSKILL. You have a few seconds of invulnerability. Give the healer a chance to heal you back up. \u0026hellip;you will get a weakness debuff. This means your main stat (STR, DEX, INT, MIND) is reduced by 25%. If you die again while under the weakness effect, you get the Brink of Death debuff which reduces those stats down by 50%.  Know your interrupts! You can find most interrupts in your \u0026ldquo;Actions \u0026amp; Traits\u0026rdquo; window under the section \u0026ldquo;Role\u0026rdquo;\n You have to test to find out which stuns / interrupts work. General rule of thumb, is the left castbar can be stunned or interrupted, and the right may be stunable.\n There are two types of cast bars, as seen below.    Interruptable This may be stunnable          The different types of interrupts    Interrupt Icon Name Role that uses it What it does      Leg Sweep NIN, DRG, MNK, SAM Stuns    Head Graze BRD, MCH, DNC Spell Interrupt    Low Blow DRK, PLD, WAR, GNB Stuns    Interject DRK, PLD, WAR, GNB Spell Interrupt    Shield Bash PLD Stun: It requires planning as it is on the GCD    Repose WHM, SCH, AST Sleep (counts as a stun): but requires cast time or Swiftcast; rarely used in dungeons, trials, etc    Sleep BLM Sleep (counts as a stun): requires cast time or Swiftcast; rarely used in dungeons, trials, etc    Know your puddles! These will heal you and/or reduce damage taken!\n    White Mage Scholar Astrologian          Heals those in it Heals / mitigates damage Heals / Damage    These do damage to enemies when they stand in it!\n    Ninja Dark Knight Summoner          Does damage to targets in it Does damage to targets in it Does damage to targets in it    "

This does not mean you have lost threat so you do not need use Provoke (see next statement). Instead, look at the two locations listed below to verify if you still have threat or not.\n    Target of Target Enemy List         The boss focused on Tirzah to start, then Maiq Provoked and the target of target changed Red means you are top of threat; Orange means you\u0026rsquo;re near the top of the threat list; Yellow means you halfway up the threat list; Green means you are very low on the threat list    As a tank, you want those boxes to be red! Red is your favourite color in the enemy list.\n Provoke is not used on cooldown All provoke does is set your emnity to be equal to the highest level eminity currently on that target and then gives you a tiny bit extra emnity on top. Even if you are the one on top! Save it for an emergancy.\n Minimize Movement Melee jobs have positionals and you make them lose damage by moving a lot.\n Pace your use of mitigations, do not use them all at once  ROLE BASED: Rampart, Reprisal, Arm\u0026rsquo;s Length PLD: Sheltron, Sentinal, and others WAR: Thill of Battle, Vengeance, Raw Intuition, Equilibrium, and others GNB: Camouflage, Nebula, Aurora (good for pulling with heal emnity), and others DRK: Shadow Wall, Dark Mind, Dark Missionary, and others  Your Immunities should not be used on cooldown, save for dire purposes (large aoe pack pulls as an example)  PLD: Hallowed Ground WAR: Holmgang GNB: Superbolide DRK: Living Dead  "
